# MetronomeSync
This was written as a tool for my high school drumline. We wanted to be able to sync a metronome across all of our phones at once, so we could play together across a distance. The instructor inputs a tempo and clicks start, which gives them a sync code. All of the players then input the same tempo and sync code, and their devices will click together. Developing this introduced me to cross-platform app development using Xamarin Forms for the .NET developer platform. The program was never finished, so, while functional, it does not have a professional GUI and is innacurate on some device.
